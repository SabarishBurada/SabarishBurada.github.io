    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Sabarish Burada, a 10th-grade student from Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh, India — a small town where opportunities are limited, but my curiosity is endless. Without access to clubs or competitions at school, I’ve built my own path. I study robotics, artificial intelligence, and physics concepts like space and time through online resources, hands-on home experiments, and self-guided learning.
      <br><br>
      I believe science isn’t just for labs — it lives in our questions, our imagination, and the small things we create with what we have. To me, knowledge isn’t always about learning and answering — it’s about questioning. That’s what drives me to explore, build, and share.
      <br><br>
      I also enjoy storytelling — using blogs and writing to express my thoughts and discoveries. Through this site, I’m combining my interests in science, coding, and creativity into one portfolio that reflects both who I am and who I want to become.
      <br><br>
      My dream is to study at a place that values passion, creativity, and resilience — qualities I’ve developed while learning independently. I hope to take this journey further through an Ivy League education.
